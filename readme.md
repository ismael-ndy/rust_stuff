# 🦀 Rust Stuff — A Collection of Mini Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of **mini Rust programs** built to practice and understand core Rust concepts through hands-on experimentation.

Each project focuses on a specific aspect of the language and is intentionally kept small and focused.
